# Updated SolidRusT Agentic API Development Roadmap

## Completed Tasks
1. Set up basic project structure
2. Implemented core agent logic (`app/core/agent.py`)
3. Created API models for agent, message, function, and memory
4. Implemented agent, message, function, and memory endpoints
5. Set up logging utility
6. Implemented basic authentication
7. Created and updated `requirements.txt`
8. Updated `README.md` with setup instructions
9. Implemented memory system with Redis and ChromaDB integration
10. Successfully ran the application with a welcome message

## Current Phase: API Refinement and Testing

1. **API Documentation**
   - [ ] Generate OpenAPI (Swagger) documentation
   - [ ] Create detailed API usage guide

2. **Testing**
   - [ ] Set up testing framework (pytest)
   - [ ] Write unit tests for core functionality
   - [ ] Write integration tests for API endpoints

3. **Error Handling and Validation**
   - [ ] Implement comprehensive error handling across all endpoints
   - [ ] Add input validation for all API endpoints

4. **Authentication and Security**
   - [ ] Enhance authentication mechanism (consider JWT)
   - [ ] Implement role-based access control
   - [ ] Add API key rotation mechanism

5. **Performance Optimization**
   - [ ] Profile API performance
   - [ ] Optimize database queries and caching strategies
   - [ ] Implement asynchronous processing where applicable

## Next Phase: Advanced Features and Scaling

6. **Advanced Agent Capabilities**
   - [ ] Implement multi-agent collaboration system
   - [ ] Develop plugin system for extending agent capabilities

7. **Scaling and Infrastructure**
   - [ ] Implement horizontal scaling strategies
   - [ ] Set up load balancing
   - [ ] Develop a robust logging and monitoring system

8. **Containerization and Deployment**
   - [ ] Create Dockerfile
   - [ ] Set up Docker Compose for local development
   - [ ] Prepare deployment scripts for production environment

9. **User Management and Metrics**
   - [ ] Implement user account system
   - [ ] Develop usage tracking and billing system
   - [ ] Create analytics dashboard for API usage insights

10. **Compliance and Ethics**
    - [ ] Implement data governance and privacy controls
    - [ ] Develop audit trails for agent actions
    - [ ] Create system for detecting and mitigating biased behavior

## Final Phase: Production Readiness and Launch

11. **Production Environment Setup**
    - [ ] Finalize Dockerfile and docker-compose setup
    - [ ] Set up staging and production environments
    - [ ] Implement robust backup and recovery systems

12. **Documentation and Support**
    - [ ] Create comprehensive API documentation website
    - [ ] Develop troubleshooting guide and FAQs
    - [ ] Set up support ticketing system

13. **Launch Preparation**
    - [ ] Conduct security audit
    - [ ] Perform load testing and stress testing
    - [ ] Develop launch marketing materials and documentation

14. **Post-Launch**
    - [ ] Monitor system performance and user feedback
    - [ ] Implement iterative improvements based on user needs
    - [ ] Plan for future feature developments and expansions
