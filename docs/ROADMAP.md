7. Created and updated `requirements.txt`
8. Updated `README.md` with setup instructions
9. Implemented memory system with Redis and ChromaDB integration
10. Successfully ran the application with a welcome message
11. Enhanced API documentation using Swagger UI
12. Implemented function registration and management system
13. Added function assignment and removal capabilities for agents
14. Implemented actual function execution logic in the `Agent` class

## Current Phase: API Refinement and Advanced Features

1. **Function System Enhancements**
   - [ ] Implement asynchronous function support
   - [ ] Add more robust type checking and conversion for function parameters
   - [ ] Implement function versioning system
   - [ ] Create a set of built-in functions available to all agents

2. **Agent System Improvements**
   - [ ] Implement agent state persistence
   - [ ] Add support for agent templates or archetypes
   - [ ] Develop a system for inter-agent communication

3. **Memory System Optimization**
   - [ ] Implement more sophisticated memory retrieval algorithms
   - [ ] Add support for hierarchical memory structures
   - [ ] Optimize long-term memory storage and retrieval

4. **LLM Integration Enhancements**
   - [ ] Add support for multiple LLM providers
   - [ ] Implement fallback mechanisms for LLM failures
   - [ ] Develop a system for LLM output parsing and validation

5. **Security and Access Control**
   - [ ] Implement role-based access control for API endpoints
   - [ ] Develop a comprehensive authentication system
   - [ ] Implement rate limiting and usage quotas

6. **Monitoring and Observability**
   - [ ] Set up comprehensive logging and monitoring
   - [ ] Implement performance tracking and analytics
   - [ ] Develop a dashboard for system health and usage statistics

## Next Phase: Scaling and Production Readiness

7. **Scalability Enhancements**
   - [ ] Implement horizontal scaling strategies

9. **Documentation and User Guide**
   - [ ] Create detailed API documentation
   - [ ] Develop user guide and tutorials
   - [ ] Create SDK for popular programming languages

10. **Deployment and Operations**
    - [ ] Finalize Dockerfile and docker-compose setup
    - [ ] Prepare deployment scripts for various cloud providers
    - [ ] Implement backup and disaster recovery strategies

## Future Considerations

11. **Advanced AI Features**
    - [ ] Implement multi-agent collaboration systems
    - [ ] Develop advanced reasoning and planning capabilities
    - [ ] Explore integration with other AI technologies (e.g., computer vision, speech recognition)

12. **Ecosystem Development**
    - [ ] Create a marketplace for custom functions and agent templates
    - [ ] Develop tools for visual agent and workflow design
    - [ ] Foster a community of developers and researchers around the platform

13. **Ethical AI and Governance**
    - [ ] Implement safeguards against misuse
    - [ ] Develop transparency and explainability features
    - [ ] Create governance structures for responsible AI development
