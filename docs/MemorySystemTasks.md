# Memory System Enhancement Tasks

## 1. Implement Advanced Search Functionality

1.1. Develop a new `AdvancedSearchQuery` model in `app/api/models/memory.py`
   - Include fields for complex query parameters (e.g., time range, relevance threshold)

1.2. Update `app/core/memory/vector_memory.py` to support advanced search
   - Implement semantic search using ChromaDB's built-in capabilities
   - Add support for filtering based on metadata

1.3. Enhance `app/core/memory/redis_memory.py` for improved short-term memory search
   - Implement pattern matching for more flexible key searches
   - Add support for sorting results based on recency

1.4. Update `app/core/memory/memory_system.py` to integrate advanced search across both memory types
   - Create a new method `advanced_search` that combines results from both memory systems
   - Implement logic to merge and rank results from both systems

1.5. Add a new endpoint in `app/api/endpoints/memory.py` for advanced search
   - Create a POST route `/memory/advanced-search` that accepts the new `AdvancedSearchQuery` model

## 2. Add Support for Memory Context and Relevance Scoring

2.1. Create a new `MemoryContext` model in `app/api/models/memory.py`
   - Include fields for context type, timestamp, and associated metadata

2.2. Update `MemoryEntry` model to include context information

2.3. Modify `app/core/memory/vector_memory.py` to store and utilize context information
   - Update the `add` method to include context when storing memories
   - Modify the search functionality to consider context in relevance calculations

2.4. Implement a relevance scoring system in `app/core/memory/memory_system.py`
   - Create a `calculate_relevance_score` function that considers factors like recency, context similarity, and semantic similarity
   - Update the `search` and `advanced_search` methods to include relevance scores in results

2.5. Update `app/api/endpoints/memory.py` to support context in memory operations
   - Modify the add and retrieve endpoints to handle context information

## 3. Optimize Memory Retrieval Algorithms

3.1. Implement caching for frequently accessed memories in `app/core/memory/memory_system.py`
   - Use Redis to cache the most recently or frequently accessed long-term memories

3.2. Develop a pre-fetching mechanism for related memories
   - Create a `pre_fetch_related_memories` method that retrieves potentially relevant memories based on current context

3.3. Implement parallel retrieval from short-term and long-term memory
   - Use asyncio to concurrently query both memory systems

3.4. Create a `MemoryRetrievalStrategy` class in `app/core/memory/retrieval_strategies.py`
   - Implement different retrieval strategies (e.g., most recent, most relevant, balanced)
   - Allow dynamic selection of retrieval strategy based on agent configuration or query parameters

3.5. Optimize ChromaDB usage for faster vector searches
   - Investigate and implement performance tweaks for ChromaDB (e.g., optimizing index settings, using approximate nearest neighbor search)

3.6. Implement memory consolidation logic
   - Create a background task that periodically moves relevant short-term memories to long-term storage
   - Implement logic to merge or update similar memories to reduce redundancy

## 4. Testing and Documentation

4.1. Write unit tests for all new functionality
   - Create test cases in `tests/core/memory/` for each new method and class

4.2. Update existing integration tests to cover new memory capabilities
   - Modify tests in `tests/api/test_memory.py` to include advanced search and context-aware operations

4.3. Update API documentation
   - Add detailed descriptions for new endpoints and models in OpenAPI/Swagger docs

4.4. Create usage examples for new memory features
   - Add examples to `examples/` directory showcasing advanced search and context-aware memory operations

## 5. Performance Monitoring

5.1. Implement logging for memory operations
   - Add detailed logging in `app/core/memory/memory_system.py` for all memory operations

5.2. Create performance benchmarks for memory operations
   - Develop scripts to measure and report on memory operation performance

5.3. Set up monitoring for memory usage and operation times
   - Integrate with the planned observability system to track key memory system metrics
