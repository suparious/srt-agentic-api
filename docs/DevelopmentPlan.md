# Updated SolidRusT Agentic API Development Plan

## Phase 1: Core Functionality and Testing (Immediate Priority)

1. **Fix and Enhance Testing Framework**
   - [ ] Resolve `test_client` fixture issues in API tests
   - [ ] Update AsyncClient usage in tests to ensure proper asynchronous testing
   - [ ] Implement comprehensive mocking of dependencies in tests
   - [ ] Increase test coverage to at least 80% for core functionality

2. **Address Core Functionality Issues**
   - [ ] Debug and fix Agent initialization process
   - [ ] Ensure proper function execution within the Agent class
   - [ ] Resolve any issues with memory system integration (Redis and ChromaDB)
   - [ ] Implement robust error handling and logging throughout the core modules

3. **Refine API Endpoints and Models**
   - [ ] Review and update all API endpoints for consistency and error handling
   - [ ] Update Pydantic models to v2 syntax and resolve deprecation warnings
   - [ ] Implement proper input validation and error responses for all endpoints
   - [ ] Ensure all endpoints are properly documented with clear request/response examples

4. **Enhance Memory System**
   - [ ] Optimize memory retrieval algorithms for both short-term and long-term memory
   - [ ] Implement more sophisticated memory search functionality
   - [ ] Add support for memory context and relevance scoring

5. **Improve LLM Provider Integration**
   - [ ] Implement actual API calls to supported LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
   - [ ] Add comprehensive error handling and retries for LLM API calls
   - [ ] Develop a fallback mechanism for LLM provider failures

## Phase 2: Advanced Features and Optimizations

6. **Implement Advanced Agent Capabilities**
   - [ ] Develop more sophisticated reasoning algorithms for agents
   - [ ] Implement context-aware function calling
   - [ ] Add support for multi-turn conversations and maintaining conversation state

7. **Enhance Function System**
   - [ ] Implement function versioning to allow for updates without breaking existing agents
   - [ ] Add support for more complex parameter types and return values
   - [ ] Develop a system for dynamic function discovery and registration

8. **Security Enhancements**
   - [ ] Implement role-based access control for API endpoints
   - [ ] Add rate limiting and usage quotas to prevent abuse
   - [ ] Conduct a comprehensive security audit of the entire system

9. **Performance Optimizations**
   - [ ] Implement caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data
   - [ ] Optimize database queries and indexing strategies
   - [ ] Implement parallel processing where applicable, especially for agent operations

10. **Scalability Improvements**
    - [ ] Design and implement horizontal scaling strategies
    - [ ] Develop load balancing mechanisms for distributed deployments
    - [ ] Optimize the system for cloud deployment (AWS, GCP, or Azure)

## Phase 3: Production Readiness and Advanced Features

11. **Monitoring and Observability**
    - [ ] Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring throughout the application
    - [ ] Develop a dashboard for system health and usage statistics
    - [ ] Set up alerting for critical system events and errors

12. **Documentation and User Guide**
    - [ ] Create detailed API documentation with interactive examples
    - [ ] Develop a comprehensive user guide for setting up and using the system
    - [ ] Create tutorials and use-case examples for common scenarios

13. **Continuous Integration and Deployment**
    - [ ] Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment
    - [ ] Implement automated version bumping and changelog generation
    - [ ] Develop deployment scripts for various cloud providers

14. **Advanced AI Features**
    - [ ] Implement multi-agent collaboration systems
    - [ ] Develop advanced planning and reasoning capabilities for agents
    - [ ] Explore integration with other AI technologies (e.g., computer vision, speech recognition)

15. **Ecosystem Development**
    - [ ] Create SDKs for popular programming languages to interact with the API
    - [ ] Develop tools for visual agent and workflow design
    - [ ] Consider creating a marketplace for custom functions and agent templates

## Ongoing Tasks

- Regularly update dependencies and address security vulnerabilities
- Conduct code reviews for all new features and significant changes
- Maintain and update documentation as the system evolves
- Gather and incorporate user feedback for continuous improvement
- Stay updated with advancements in AI and LLM technologies, and integrate relevant improvements

This updated plan addresses the immediate concerns highlighted in the current plan while also incorporating longer-term goals from the roadmap. It provides a clear, phased approach to development, focusing first on stabilizing core functionality and testing, then moving on to advanced features and optimizations, and finally preparing the system for production use and future expansion.
