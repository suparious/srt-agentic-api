2. **Enhance Testing Framework**
   - [x] Implement comprehensive mocking of dependencies in tests
   - [x] Increase test coverage for core functionality
   - [x] Add integration tests for API endpoints and LLM providers

3. **Update API Endpoints and Models**
   - [x] Update endpoints to accept multiple LLM provider configurations
   - [x] Update Pydantic models to support multi-provider setup
   - [x] Implement more detailed error responses for all endpoints

4. **Improve Documentation**
   - [x] Update README with multi-provider support and fallback mechanism information
   - [x] Update API documentation to reflect changes in endpoints and models

## Phase 2: Advanced Features and Optimizations (Current Focus)

5. **Enhance Memory System**

## Phase 3: Scalability and Production Readiness

10. **Scalability Improvements**
    - [ ] Design and implement horizontal scaling strategies
    - [ ] Develop load balancing mechanisms for distributed deployments
    - [ ] Optimize the system for cloud deployment (AWS, GCP, or Azure)

11. **Continuous Integration and Deployment**
    - [ ] Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment
    - [ ] Implement automated version bumping and changelog generation
    - [ ] Develop deployment scripts for various cloud providers

12. **Advanced AI Features**
    - [ ] Implement multi-agent collaboration systems
    - [ ] Develop advanced planning and reasoning capabilities for agents
    - [ ] Explore integration with other AI technologies (e.g., computer vision, speech recognition)

13. **Ecosystem Development**
    - [ ] Create SDKs for popular programming languages to interact with the API
    - [ ] Develop tools for visual agent and workflow design
    - [ ] Consider creating a marketplace for custom functions and agent templates

## Ongoing Tasks

- Regularly update dependencies and address security vulnerabilities
- Conduct code reviews for all new features and significant changes
- Maintain and update documentation as the system evolves
- Gather and incorporate user feedback for continuous improvement
- Stay updated with advancements in AI and LLM technologies, and integrate relevant improvements

This updated plan reflects our recent progress in implementing the advanced memory system and resolving configuration issues. The immediate focus should be on implementing advanced agent capabilities, enhancing security features, and improving performance and monitoring.
