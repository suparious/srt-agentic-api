# Updated SolidRusT Agentic API Development Plan

## Phase 1: Core Functionality and Testing (Current Focus)

1. **Enhance LLM Provider Integration**
   - [x] Implement actual API calls to supported LLM providers (OpenAI, vLLM, LlamaCpp, TGI)
   - [ ] Add comprehensive error handling and retries for LLM API calls
   - [ ] Develop a fallback mechanism for LLM provider failures

2. **Enhance Testing Framework**
   - [ ] Implement comprehensive mocking of dependencies in tests
   - [ ] Increase test coverage to at least 80% for core functionality
   - [ ] Add integration tests for API endpoints and LLM providers

3. **Enhance Memory System**
   - [ ] Implement advanced memory search functionality
   - [ ] Add support for memory context and relevance scoring
   - [ ] Optimize memory retrieval algorithms for both short-term and long-term memory

4. **Improve API Documentation and Error Handling**
   - [ ] Enhance API documentation with clear request/response examples
   - [ ] Implement more detailed error responses for all endpoints
   - [ ] Add request validation for all endpoints

5. **Implement Security Features**
   - [ ] Add authentication mechanism (e.g., JWT or API key)
   - [ ] Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
   - [ ] Add input sanitization to prevent injection attacks

## Phase 2: Advanced Features and Optimizations

6. **Implement Advanced Agent Capabilities**
   - [ ] Develop more sophisticated reasoning algorithms for agents
   - [ ] Implement context-aware function calling
   - [ ] Add support for multi-turn conversations and maintaining conversation state

7. **Enhance Function System**
   - [ ] Implement function versioning to allow for updates without breaking existing agents
   - [ ] Add support for more complex parameter types and return values
   - [ ] Develop a system for dynamic function discovery and registration

8. **Performance Optimizations**
   - [ ] Implement caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data
   - [ ] Optimize database queries and indexing strategies
   - [ ] Implement parallel processing where applicable, especially for agent operations

9. **Scalability Improvements**
   - [ ] Design and implement horizontal scaling strategies
   - [ ] Develop load balancing mechanisms for distributed deployments
   - [ ] Optimize the system for cloud deployment (AWS, GCP, or Azure)

10. **Monitoring and Observability**
    - [ ] Implement comprehensive logging throughout the application
    - [ ] Develop a dashboard for system health and usage statistics
    - [ ] Set up alerting for critical system events and errors

## Phase 3: Production Readiness and Advanced Features

11. **Continuous Integration and Deployment**
    - [ ] Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment
    - [ ] Implement automated version bumping and changelog generation
    - [ ] Develop deployment scripts for various cloud providers

12. **Advanced AI Features**
    - [ ] Implement multi-agent collaboration systems
    - [ ] Develop advanced planning and reasoning capabilities for agents
    - [ ] Explore integration with other AI technologies (e.g., computer vision, speech recognition)

13. **Ecosystem Development**
    - [ ] Create SDKs for popular programming languages to interact with the API
    - [ ] Develop tools for visual agent and workflow design
    - [ ] Consider creating a marketplace for custom functions and agent templates

## Ongoing Tasks

- Regularly update dependencies and address security vulnerabilities
- Conduct code reviews for all new features and significant changes
- Maintain and update documentation as the system evolves
- Gather and incorporate user feedback for continuous improvement
- Stay updated with advancements in AI and LLM technologies, and integrate relevant improvements

This updated plan reflects our recent progress in implementing LLM providers and adjusts our priorities accordingly. The immediate focus should be on completing the LLM provider integration by adding comprehensive error handling, retries, and fallback mechanisms.
