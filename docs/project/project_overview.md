### Phase 3: Scalability and Production Readiness
(This phase remains unchanged from the original DevelopmentPlan.md)

## 3. Immediate Action Items

1. Fix failing tests and increase test coverage to at least 80%
   - Review and update tests in `tests/core/memory/test_redis_memory.py`
   - Fix issues in `app/core/memory/redis_memory.py`, particularly the `add` method
   - Address async testing and event loop management issues

2. Refactor and optimize the memory system code
   - Review and update `app/core/memory/memory_system.py`
   - Ensure proper integration between short-term and long-term memory
   - Implement robust error handling for memory operations

3. Update API documentation to reflect recent changes in memory and agent functionalities

4. Implement remaining security features
   - Add rate limiting
   - Implement comprehensive input sanitization

5. Enhance Agent Implementation
   - Review and fix `LLMProviderConfig` usage in `app/core/agent.py`
   - Implement proper attribute access for UUID objects
   - Add necessary attributes or methods to the Agent class

6. Improve LLM Provider Integration
   - Implement more robust error handling and fallback mechanisms in `app/core/llm_provider.py`
   - Enhance tests in `tests/test_core/test_llm_provider.py`

7. Optimize API Endpoint Implementation
   - Review and update API endpoint implementations in `app/api/endpoints/`
   - Ensure proper error handling and status code returns
   - Implement input validation using Pydantic models

## 4. Ongoing Tasks

- Regularly update dependencies and address security vulnerabilities
- Conduct code reviews for all new features and significant changes
- Maintain and update documentation as the system evolves
- Gather and incorporate user feedback for continuous improvement
- Stay updated with advancements in AI and LLM technologies, and integrate relevant improvements
