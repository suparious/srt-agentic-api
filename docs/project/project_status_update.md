# Project Status Update

## Current Status
- Code coverage: 56% (Target: 80%)
- Passing tests: 52 out of 117 (44% pass rate)
- Failed tests: 22
- Errors: 43

## Progress Made
1. Fixed MemoryEntry 'id' attribute issue
2. Improved Vector Memory search and retrieval
3. Updated LLMProviderConfig to include 'provider_type'
4. Refactored RedisMemory initialization

## Remaining Issues and Priorities

1. **Redis Memory Operations** (High Priority)
   - Fix Redis memory lifecycle and add operations
   - Address "Failed to add memory" errors in Redis memory tests

2. **LLM Provider Configuration** (High Priority)
   - Resolve 'dict' object has no attribute 'provider_type' errors
   - Ensure LLMProviderConfig is correctly used throughout the codebase

3. **AgentConfig Validation** (High Priority)
   - Fix validation errors for AgentConfig in core agent tests

4. **Async Setup Issues** (Medium Priority)
   - Resolve 'RedisMemory' object has no attribute 'redis' error
   - Fix VectorMemory async setup assertion error

5. **Integration Test Discrepancies** (Medium Priority)
   - Align expected and actual results in Redis and Vector memory integration tests

6. **API Endpoint Tests** (Medium Priority)
   - Fix errors in agent, function, memory, and message API tests

7. **Vector Memory Edge Cases** (Low Priority)
   - Address remaining issues with vector memory search and retrieval edge cases

8. **Improve Test Coverage** (Ongoing)
   - Incrementally increase test coverage, focusing on core components first

## Next Steps
1. Update RedisMemory class to properly handle Redis operations:
   - Review and fix the add, get, search, and delete methods
   - Ensure proper error handling and connection management

2. Refactor LLM Provider usage:
   - Update all occurrences of LLM provider configuration to use the correct structure
   - Ensure consistent use of provider_type attribute

3. Review and update AgentConfig model:
   - Identify and fix the validation error in the AgentConfig
   - Update tests to use the correct AgentConfig structure

4. Improve async handling in memory components:
   - Ensure proper initialization of Redis and Vector memory in async context
   - Review and update async setup in test fixtures

5. Align integration tests with actual behavior:
   - Review expectations in Redis and Vector memory integration tests
   - Update test cases to reflect the current implementation

6. Fix API endpoint tests:
   - Review and update mocking strategy for API tests
   - Ensure proper setup and teardown for each API test

7. Address Vector Memory edge cases:
   - Review and fix issues with search filters and result counts
   - Improve error handling in vector memory operations

8. Continuous test coverage improvement:
   - Identify areas with low coverage and add targeted tests
   - Refactor complex functions to improve testability

## Questions and Clarifications
1. Are there any known issues with the Redis server configuration that might be contributing to the connection problems?
2. Is there a specific reason for the discrepancy between expected and actual result counts in memory search operations?
3. Are there any performance benchmarks or requirements for the memory operations, especially when dealing with large datasets?
