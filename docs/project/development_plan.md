    - [ ] Develop advanced planning and reasoning capabilities for agents
    - [ ] Explore integration with other AI technologies (e.g., computer vision, speech recognition)
    - [ ] Implement fine-tuning capabilities for LLMs

13. **Ecosystem Development**
    - [ ] Create SDKs for popular programming languages to interact with the API
    - [ ] Develop tools for visual agent and workflow design
    - [ ] Consider creating a marketplace for custom functions and agent templates
    - [ ] Develop plugins for popular development environments and tools

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Complete the remaining tasks in the "Enhance Memory System" section
2. Begin implementation of advanced agent capabilities
3. Continue improving test coverage, aiming for at least 80%
4. Address any remaining issues or bugs identified during the test suite enhancement

## Ongoing Tasks
- Regularly update dependencies and address security vulnerabilities
- Conduct code reviews for all new features and significant changes
- Maintain and update documentation as the system evolves
- Gather and incorporate user feedback for continuous improvement
- Stay updated with advancements in AI and LLM technologies, and integrate relevant improvements

This updated plan reflects the progress made in enhancing our test suite and sets clear priorities for the next development cycle.
