# Test Improvement Plan

## Current Test Status
- Overall test coverage: 52%
- 6 failed tests
- 41 errors
- 7 passed tests

## Categories of Issues

1. Pydantic Validation Errors
   - Multiple tests are failing due to `pydantic_core._pydantic_core.ValidationError`
   - This seems to be related to the `AgentConfig` model

2. Type Errors
   - Some tests are failing due to `TypeError`, particularly in the `VectorMemory` class

3. Runtime Errors
   - Several tests are encountering `RuntimeError`, often related to asyncio and event loops

4. Attribute Errors
   - Some tests are failing due to `AttributeError`, particularly in memory-related modules

5. HTTP Status Code Mismatches
   - Some API tests are failing due to unexpected HTTP status codes

## Action Plan

1. Fix Pydantic Validation Errors
   - Review and update the `AgentConfig` model in `app/api/models/agent.py`
   - Ensure all required fields are properly defined
   - Update tests to use the correct model structure

2. Address Type Errors
   - Review the `VectorMemory` class implementation
   - Ensure type hints are correctly used and followed
   - Update method signatures if necessary

3. Resolve Runtime Errors
   - Review asyncio usage across the codebase
   - Ensure proper event loop management in tests
   - Consider using `pytest-asyncio` for better async test support

4. Fix Attribute Errors
   - Review memory-related modules, particularly `redis_memory.py` and `vector_memory.py`
   - Ensure all referenced attributes and methods exist
   - Update method calls if API has changed

5. Correct HTTP Status Code Mismatches
   - Review API endpoint implementations
   - Ensure correct status codes are returned for different scenarios
   - Update tests to expect the correct status codes

6. Increase Test Coverage
   - Identify modules with low coverage
   - Add new test cases for untested code paths
   - Ensure all edge cases are covered

## Step-by-step Approach

1. Start with fixing Pydantic Validation Errors
   - This seems to be causing the most widespread issues
   - Update `AgentConfig` model and related tests

2. Move on to Type Errors and Attribute Errors
   - These are likely related and can be addressed together
   - Focus on `VectorMemory` and memory-related modules

3. Address Runtime Errors
   - Review and update asyncio usage in tests
   - Ensure proper setup and teardown of async resources

4. Fix HTTP Status Code Mismatches
   - Review and update API endpoint tests
   - Ensure alignment between implementation and test expectations

5. Add New Tests to Increase Coverage
   - Focus on modules with less than 80% coverage
   - Add tests for edge cases and error scenarios

6. Run Tests Frequently
   - After each significant change, run the full test suite
   - Address any new issues that arise immediately

7. Document Changes
   - Update relevant documentation as tests are fixed and added
   - Note any API changes or behavior modifications

## Success Criteria
- All tests passing
- Test coverage increased to at least 80% for each module
- No remaining Pydantic validation errors
- Consistent use of async/await throughout the codebase
- Accurate API endpoint behavior reflected in tests
