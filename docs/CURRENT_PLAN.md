# SolidRusT Agentic API Development Roadmap

## Current Phase: Fixing Core Functionality and Testing Framework

1. **Fix Testing Framework**
   - [ ] Resolve `test_client` fixture issues in API tests
   - [ ] Update AsyncClient usage in tests
   - [ ] Ensure proper mocking of dependencies in tests

2. **Address Core Functionality Issues**
   - [ ] Fix Agent initialization and function execution
   - [ ] Resolve issues with memory system integration
   - [ ] Ensure proper function registration and retrieval

3. **Refine API Endpoints**
   - [ ] Review and update all API endpoints for consistency
   - [ ] Implement proper error handling in endpoints
   - [ ] Ensure all endpoints are properly tested

4. **Improve Type Annotations and Pydantic Models**
   - [ ] Update Pydantic models to v2 syntax
   - [ ] Resolve deprecation warnings
   - [ ] Ensure consistent use of type hints throughout the codebase

5. **Enhance Memory System**
   - [ ] Verify Redis and ChromaDB integrations
   - [ ] Implement more robust error handling in memory operations
   - [ ] Optimize memory retrieval algorithms

6. **Refine LLM Provider Integration**
   - [ ] Implement actual API calls to LLM providers
   - [ ] Add more comprehensive error handling for LLM API calls
   - [ ] Implement retries and fallback mechanisms

## Next Phase: Advanced Features and Optimizations
